# Dotfiles

There's nothing much in .config because you can find all of the ports elsewhere, mainly on catppuccin's github. 

For the color schemes, I mainly use Catppuccin and Tokyo Night. 

My window manager is [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), and the config is also pretty much stock so I haven't included it here.

For fonts I mainly use `FiraCode Nerd Font`, `Inter`, and `Space Mono`

The prompt is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), and I recommend using [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) for the `ls` replacement.

### Firefox

For the firefox config, it can be found at https://github.com/tnixc/firefox-config.


### VScode

I use the Catppuccin theme, and to get it to work you'll need the [Custom CSS and JS Loader Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css). I use [the catppuccin vscode theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode).

### Menubar

I use [Bartender 5](https://www.macbartender.com/) to change it's color.

### Nvim and others
For nvim I use pretty much stock [lunar vim[(https://www.lunarvim.org/), and in the terminal I use the Tokyo Night color scheme.
