# Dotfiles

There's nothing much in .config because you can find all of the ports elsewhere, mainly on catppuccin's github. 

For the color schemes, I mainly use [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) and Tokyo Night. 

My window manager is [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai), and for the borders I use [Jankyborders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders)

For fonts I mainly use `FiraCode Nerd Font`, `Inter`, `Geist`, `Geist Mono`, `Space Mono`

The prompt is [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), and I recommend using [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) for the `ls` replacement.

### ZSH

I am using oh-my-zsh and the theme is powerlevel10k. The plugins I have are `zsh-autosuggestions`,`zsh-history-substring-search`,`zsh-syntax-highlighting`

### Firefox

For the firefox config, it can be found at https://github.com/tnixc/firefox-config.

However, I mostly use Arc now.

### Sketchybar

I use Sketchybar, make sure to run `chmod +x *` in the plugins directory to make the plugins work. You can see it in the vscode screenshot.

### VScode

I use the Catppuccin theme, and to get it to work you'll need the [APC Customizer++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension). I use [the catppuccin vscode theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode).

### Menubar

I use [Bartender 5](https://www.macbartender.com/) to change it's color. But I usually use [Menuwhere](https://manytricks.com/menuwhere/).

### Nvim and terminal
For nvim I use pretty stock [lunar vim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), and in iTerm2 I use the Tokyo Night color scheme.
